<h1>The Best Movies According to Joey</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>The only one in the franchise that gets it. It understands that this is supposed to be scary, and the dinosaurs are not the villains, they are just animals doing what animals do and you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Somehow still looks better than any of the other ones as well, someone please explain that to me. </p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The first superhero movie that isn't just a good superhero movie, but just a good movie in general. The vibes are immaculate, and nothing can be said about how perfect Heath Ledgers Joker is that hasn't already been said. We were really robbed as a society of something...or hollywood would have just fucked it up to make money</p>

<h3>Friday Night Lights</h3>
<p>The perfect sports movie. Somehow it's able to hit all the sports movie checklist items, while also telling a completely compelling story. SPOILER, and I could just be talking out of my ass here, but I feel like having the hero lose was not a common trope in sports movies at this time because I remember watching this as a kid and being like wait wtf just happened, but holy shit is it ever effective</p>
